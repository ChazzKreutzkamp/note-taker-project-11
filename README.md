# Note Taker

## Description

This Application is designed to help you create notes and save them to an online server. This app will welcome you with a homepage that will prominenetly have a button displayed that will take you to a second page where your notes will be saved and reaccessible. You can create new notes by typing in the fields on the screen, where you will then be able to save and create a new note by pressing the save button in the top right corner. In addition if you click an old note to read it, you can then press the button that looks like a pencil to return to the note taking functionality of the website. (Deleting notes is still being worked on in a new branch.)
